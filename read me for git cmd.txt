1. How to bring the folder which is created in the github repo into the local ?
    keep the respected class path > git clone paste the link
2. cmd to change the classpath: cd folder name
NOTE:- .git file is acting as a bridge between local folder and git repo

3. Create a file in the local folder and make it appear in the github repo
